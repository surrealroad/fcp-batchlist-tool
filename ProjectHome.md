This is an AppleScript to correct a problem when creating a batch list (text file) for use with Final Cut Pro.

The problem is that a requirement of the Batch List is that every line must be terminated by ASCII character 13 (rather than ASCII character 10). Not doing so will produce the error that one or more headings are invalid.

There's more information on this problem here:
